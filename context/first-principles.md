## First Principles Defined Using First Principles

**Core Definition:**
- Irreducible truths that cannot be derived from anything more fundamental
- Self-evident facts requiring no proof
- The starting point for all reasoning

**Goal/Objective:**
- **Primary**: Reach the most fundamental truth of any problem or concept
- **Secondary**: Enable innovation by bypassing false assumptions
- **Tertiary**: Build robust solutions grounded in reality, not tradition
- **Ultimate**: Discover what is actually true vs. what we've been told is true

**Scope:**
- **Universal Application**: Logic, physics, philosophy, business, engineering, mathematics
- **Problem Types**: Complex systems, innovation challenges, strategic decisions
- **Intellectual Domains**: Any field where assumptions can hide truth
- **Limitation**: Most effective when fundamental truths are knowable or testable

**Constraints:**
- **Cognitive Load**: Breaking down to fundamentals is mentally expensive
- **Time Intensive**: Slower than analogical reasoning initially
- **Expertise Required**: Need domain knowledge to identify true first principles
- **Diminishing Returns**: Not every problem requires this depth
- **Reality Check**: Some "first principles" may be unknowable (philosophical limits)

**Essential Properties:**
- **Non-derivative**: Cannot be broken down further
- **Self-proving**: True by definition or observation
- **Universal**: Apply across contexts
- **Foundational**: All other knowledge builds from them

**The Method (Applied to Itself):**
1. **Strip away** → Remove all assumptions, analogies, and inherited beliefs
2. **Reach bedrock** → Identify what remains when nothing more can be removed
3. **Verify independence** → Confirm the truth stands alone without support
4. **Rebuild logically** → Construct new understanding from these truths

**In Practice:**
- Question: "Why is this true?"
- Keep asking until the answer is: "It just is" (observable fact)
- That's your first principle
- Build solutions from there, not from convention

**The Paradox:**
First principles thinking *itself* is a first principle—the fundamental truth that reasoning must start from irreducible facts.
